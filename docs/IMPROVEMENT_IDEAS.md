## 4. Specific Code Improvements (Enhanced from Reviews)

### Issues Identified
1. **Deferred/Local Import**: Hidden dependencies affect testability
2. **Blocking Async Code**: ThreadPoolExecutor in async methods (anti-pattern)
3. **Broad Exception Handling**: Catch-all exceptions hide specific errors
4. **Schema Validation**: Raw dicts instead of type-safe models
5. **Hard-coded Configurations**: Model chains and timeouts not configurable
6. **Testing Gaps**: 0% coverage for JSON-RPC and main entry

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Dependency Injection Pattern**
   ```python
   # Instead of components creating dependencies
   class Orchestrator:
       def __init__(self, registry: ToolRegistry, cache: CacheService):
           self.registry = registry  # Injected, not created
           self.cache = cache
   ```

2. **Pydantic for Type Safety**
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

   class ToolInput(BaseModel):
       """Base class for all tool inputs with validation"""
       pass

   class AskToolInput(ToolInput):
       question: str = Field(..., description="The question to ask")
       context: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Optional context")
   ```

3. **Native Async Patterns**
   ```python
   # Replace ThreadPoolExecutor with native asyncio
   response = await asyncio.wait_for(
       model.generate_content_async(prompt),
       timeout=self.timeout
   )
   ```

4. **Specific Exception Hierarchy**
   ```python
   class MCPError(Exception): pass
   class ToolNotFoundError(MCPError): pass
   class ModelTimeoutError(MCPError): pass
   class ValidationError(MCPError): pass
   ```

5. **Configuration Management**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class ModelConfig:
       primary_models: List[str]
       fallback_models: List[str]
       timeout_seconds: float = 10.0
       retry_attempts: int = 3
   ```

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Priority Areas

## 6. Architecture Review Findings (June 2025)

### Critical Technical Issues

1. **Type Safety Gap**
   - **Issue**: Using raw `dict` for `input_schema` lacks type safety and validation
   - **Solution**: Implement Pydantic models for all tool schemas
   ```python
   # Before
   input_schema: dict

   # After
   from pydantic import BaseModel
   class AskToolInput(BaseModel):
       question: str
       context: str | None = None
   ```

2. **Async/Sync Anti-pattern**
   - **Issue**: Using `ThreadPoolExecutor` for timeouts in async code
   - **Solution**: Replace with native `asyncio.wait_for`
   ```python
   # Before
   with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
       future = executor.submit(model.generate_content, prompt)

   # After
   response = await asyncio.wait_for(
       model.generate_content_async(prompt),
       timeout=10.0
   )
   ```

3. **Bundler Complexity**
   - **Issue**: Custom bundler breaks IDEs, debugging, and Python standards
   - **Solution**: Adopt standard Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`
   - **Alternative**: Use Docker for deployment instead of bundling

4. **Hard-coded Model Fallback**
   - **Issue**: Model chain `gemini-2.0-flash-exp â†’ gemini-1.5-pro` is inflexible
   - **Solution**: Configurable fallback chain via environment or config

### Architectural Patterns to Adopt

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
   ```python
   # Current: Components create their own dependencies
   class Orchestrator:
       def __init__(self):
           self.registry = ToolRegistry()  # Hard to test

   # Improved: Dependencies injected
   class Orchestrator:
       def __init__(self, registry: ToolRegistry, cache: CacheService):
           self.registry = registry
           self.cache = cache
   ```

2. **Command Bus Pattern** (Long-term)
   - Decouple MCP protocol layer from business logic
   - Enable better testing and future protocol support
   - Allow independent scaling of components

3. **Event Sourcing** (Future consideration)
   - Create audit trail of all state changes
   - Enable time-travel debugging
   - Support read-model projections

### Testing Strategy Improvements

1. **JSON-RPC Testing with FastAPI**
   ```python
   # Use FastAPI's TestClient for isolated API testing
   from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

   def test_rpc_endpoint():
       mock_orchestrator = MagicMock(spec=Orchestrator)
       app.dependency_overrides[get_orchestrator] = lambda: mock_orchestrator

       client = TestClient(app)
       response = client.post("/rpc", json={"method": "execute_tool"})
       assert response.status_code == 200
   ```

2. **Characterization Tests**
   - Before refactoring, capture current behavior
   - Use as regression test suite
   - Especially important for bundler replacement

### Observability & Monitoring

1. **Structured Logging**
   ```python
   import structlog

   logger = structlog.get_logger()
   logger.info("tool_executed",
               tool_name="ask_gemini",
               duration_ms=150,
               model_used="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
               cache_hit=False)
   ```

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Cache hit/miss ratio
   - Tool execution latency (per tool)
   - Model fallback frequency
   - API error rates
   - Request throughput

3. **Distributed Tracing** (Future)
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Request flow visualization
   - Performance bottleneck identification

### Standard Python Packaging

Replace custom bundler with standard tooling:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "gemini-mcp-server"
version = "3.0.0"
dependencies = [
    "pydantic>=2.0",
    "structlog>=24.0",
    "google-generativeai>=0.3.0",
    # ... other deps
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0",
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.21",
    "pytest-cov>=4.0",
]
```

### Deployment Strategy

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile - Standard containerized deployment
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install -e .

COPY src/ src/
CMD ["python", "-m", "gemini_mcp.main"]
```
