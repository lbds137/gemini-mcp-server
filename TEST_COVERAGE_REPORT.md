# Test Coverage Report - Gemini MCP Server

## Summary
‚úÖ **All 77 tests passing!**
üìä **Overall coverage: 50%** (up from ~30% when we started)

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed All Broken Tests
- Updated tests to work with new property-based tool API
- Fixed import patching for model_manager in ask_gemini tests
- Resolved orchestrator integration test issues
- Fixed registry discovery test mocking

### 2. Added Comprehensive Bundler Tests
- **86% coverage** on the critical bundler script
- 19 tests covering all major functionality:
  - Component discovery
  - Tool registration
  - Import cleaning
  - Bundle generation
  - Error handling
  - Edge cases (unicode, syntax errors)

### 3. Test Coverage by Component

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Models** | | |
| - base.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| - memory.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| - manager.py | 23% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs work |
| **Services** | | |
| - cache.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| - memory.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Core** | | |
| - orchestrator.py | 75% | ‚úÖ Good |
| - registry.py | 81% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Protocols** | | |
| - debate.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Tools** | | |
| - ask_gemini.py | 100% | ‚úÖ Complete |
| - base.py | 80% | ‚úÖ Good |
| - Other tools | ~37% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need tests |
| **Scripts** | | |
| - bundler.py | 86% | ‚úÖ Good |

### 4. Critical Paths Tested
- Tool discovery and registration
- Tool execution with caching
- Debate protocol flow
- Memory and cache services
- Bundle generation and compilation

## Areas Needing Improvement

### 1. Low Coverage Files
- `json_rpc.py` (0%) - Core MCP protocol implementation
- `main.py` (0%) - Server entry point
- `manager.py` (23%) - Model management
- Individual tool implementations (~37%) - Need unit tests

### 2. Missing Integration Tests
- End-to-end MCP server testing
- Full debate execution with real tools
- Model fallback scenarios
- Error recovery paths

### 3. Performance Tests
- Bundle generation speed
- Tool execution latency
- Cache effectiveness
- Memory usage patterns

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Add tests for json_rpc.py - critical for MCP functionality
2. Test model manager fallback logic
3. Add unit tests for remaining tools

### Medium Priority
1. Set up CI/CD with coverage reporting
2. Add integration tests for full workflows
3. Create performance benchmarks

### Low Priority
1. Increase coverage on main.py
2. Add property-based testing for complex scenarios
3. Create load tests for concurrent tool execution

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Implemented
- ‚úÖ Mock fixtures for model manager
- ‚úÖ Test helpers for tool creation
- ‚úÖ Proper async test support
- ‚úÖ Coverage reporting setup

### Recommended
- üî≤ GitHub Actions for CI
- üî≤ Coverage badges in README
- üî≤ Automated test running on PR
- üî≤ Performance regression tests

## Conclusion

The test suite is now in a much healthier state with all tests passing and significantly improved coverage. The bundler - a critical component for deployment - is well-tested. The core functionality (orchestrator, registry, base tools) has good coverage.

The main gaps are in the MCP protocol layer and individual tool implementations, which should be addressed next to ensure robust operation in production environments.
